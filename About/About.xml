    <description>Adds icons to every vanilla prosthetic and implant. 

Also adds a special texture for stacks of implants in case you have a mod that allows you to stack them.

2.0: Patch Operations have been replaced by C# code that looks for key words and assigns textures and colors accordingly. This means that instead of relying on compatibility on the side of this mod it now relies on mods that add prosthetics to use the right words in their defnames.

The result is that basically any mod that adds any prosthetic is compatible now.
