    <description>Adds a single workbench for all prosthetics. This is mainly an enhancement to vanilla, however it supports all mods that use the fabricator and machining table. For example [FSF] Vanilla Bionics Expansion. Mods that have their own workbenches are generally not supported, mostly because there is no reason to.</description>
